## Preparing your development environment

The first step is to install the `anl` package using:

```bash
pip install anl
```

The second step in developing your agent for ANL 2024 is to download the template from [here](https://yasserfarouk.github.io/files/anl/anl.zip). Please familiarize yourself with the competition rules availabe at the [competition website](https://scml.cs.brown.edu/anl).

After downloading and uncompressing the template, you should do the following steps:

1. Modify the name of the single class in `myagent.py` (currently called `MyNegotiator`) to a representative name for your agent. We will use `AwsomeNegotiator` here. You should then implement your agent logic by modifying this class.
   - Remember to change the name of the agent in the last line of the file to match your new class name (`AwsomeNegotiator`).
   - Remember to update the `agent class` in the submission form on the  [competition website](https://scml.cs.brown.edu/anl) to `AwsomeNegotiator`.
2. Start developing your agent as will be explained later in this tutorial
3. You can use the following ways to test your agent:
    - Run the following command to test your agent from the root folder of the extracted skeleton:
      ```bash
      python -m myagent.myagent
      ```
    - Use the `anl` command line utility from the root folder of the extracted skeleton:
      ```bash
      anl tournament2024 --path=. --competitors="myagent.myagnet.AwsomeNegotiator;Boulware;Conceder"
      ```
      This method is more flexible as you can control all aspects of the tournament to run.
      Use `anl tournament2024 --help`  to see all available options.

    - You can directly call `anl2024_tournament()` passing your agent as one of the competitors. This is the most flexible method and will be used in this tutorial.


## Developing a negotiator

Agents for the ANL competition are standard [NegMAS](https://yasserfarouk.github.io/negmas) negotiators. As such, they can be developed using any approach used to develop negotiators in NegMAS.

To develop a negotiator, you need to inherit from the [SAONegotiator](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.sao.SAONegotiator.html) class and implement the [__call__](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.sao.SAONegotiator.html#negmas.sao.SAONegotiator.__call__) method.

Here is a simple random negotiator:


```python
import random
from negmas.sao import SAONegotiator, SAOResponse
from negmas import Outcome, ResponseType
class MyRandomNegotiator(SAONegotiator):
    def __call__(self, state):
        offer = state.current_offer
        if offer is not None and self.ufun.is_not_worse(offer, None) and random.random() < 0.25 :
            return SAOResponse(ResponseType.ACCEPT_OFFER, offer)
        return SAOResponse(ResponseType.REJECT_OFFER, self.nmi.random_outcomes(1)[0])
```

### Testing the agent


```python
from anl.anl2024 import anl2024_tournament
from anl.anl2024.negotiators import Boulware, Conceder, RVFitter
```


```python
results = anl2024_tournament(
    n_scenarios=1, n_repetitions=3, nologs=True, njobs=-1,
    competitors=[MyRandomNegotiator, Boulware]
)
```


<pre style="white-space:pre;overflow-x:auto;line-height:normal;font-family:Menlo,'DejaVu Sans Mono',consolas,'Courier New',monospace">Will run <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">12</span> negotiations on <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">1</span> scenarios between <span style="color: #008080; text-decoration-color: #008080; font-weight: bold">2</span> competitors

</pre>



We can immediately notice that `MyRandomNegotiator` is getting a negative average advantage which means that it sometimes gets agreements that are worse than disagreement (i.e. with utility less than its reserved value). Can you guess why is this happening? How can we resolve that?

You can easily check the final scores using the `final_scores` member of the returned [SimpleTournamentResults](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.tournaments.SimpleTournamentResults.html) object


```python
results.final_scores
```




<div>
<style scoped>
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {
        vertical-align: middle;
    }

    .dataframe tbody tr th {
        vertical-align: top;
    }

    .dataframe thead th {
        text-align: right;
    }
</style>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">

    <tr style="text-align: right;">

    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>

      <td>Boulware</td>
      <td>0.701151</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th>1</th>
      <td>MyRandomNegotiator</td>
      <td>0.083134</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>



The returned results are all pandas dataframes. We can use standard pandas functions to get deeper understanding of the results. Here is how to plot a KDE figure comparing different strategies in this tournament:



```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8,6))
df = results.scores
for label, data in df.groupby('strategy'):
    data.advantage.plot(kind="kde", ax=ax, label=label)
plt.ylabel("advantage")
plt.legend();
```

```python
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(16,4))
for i, col in enumerate(["advantage", "welfare", "nash_optimality"]):
    results.scores.groupby("strategy")[col].mean().sort_index().plot(kind="bar", ax=axs[i])
    axs[i].set_ylabel(col)
```

## Available helpers

Our negotaitor was not so good but it examplifies the simplest method for developing a negotiator in NegMAS. For more information refer to [NegMAS Documentation](https://negmas.readthedocs.io). You develop your agent, as explained above, by implementing the `__call__` method of your class. 

This method, receives an [SAOState](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.sao.SAOState.html) which represents the current `state` of the negotiation. The most important members of this state object are `current_offer` which gives the current offer from the partner (or `None` if this is the beginning of the negotiation) and `relative_time` which gives the relative time of the negotiation ranging between `0` and `1`.

It should return an [SAOResponse](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.sao.SAOResponse.html) represeting the agent's `response` which consists of two parts:

1. A [ResponseType](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.gb.ResponseType.html) with the following allowed values:
    - `ResponseType.ACCEPT_OFFER`, accepts the current offer (pass the current offer as the second member of the response).
    - `ResponseType.REJECT_OFFER`, rejects the current offer (pass you counter-offer as the second member of the response).
    - `ResponseType.END_NEGOTIATION`, ends the negotiation immediately (pass `None` as the second member of the response).
2. A counter offer (in case of rejection), the received offer (in case of acceptance) or `None` if ending the negotiation.

The negotiator can use the following objects to help it implement its strategy:

- `self.nmi` A [SAONMI](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.sao.SAONMI.html) that gives you access to all the settings of this negotiation and provide some simple helpers:
    - `n_steps`, `time_limit` The number of rounds and seconds allowed for this negotiation (`None` means no limit).
    - `random_outcomes(n)` Samples `n` random outcomes from this negotiation.
    - `outcome_space` The [OutcomeSpace](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.outcomes.OutcomeSpace.html) of the negotiation which represent all possible agreements. In ANL 2024, this will always be of type [DiscreteCartesianOutcomeSpace](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.outcomes.DiscreteCartesianOutcomeSpace.html) with a single issue.
    - `discrete_outcomes()` A generator of all outcomes in the outcome space.
    - `log_info()` Logs structured information for this negotiator that can be checked in the logs later (Similarily there are `log_error`, `log_warning`, `log_debug`). 
- `self.ufun` A [LinearAdditiveUtilityFunction](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.LinearAdditiveUtilityFunction.html#negmas.preferences.LinearAdditiveUtilityFunction) representing the agent's own utility function. This object provides some helpful functionality including:
   - `self.ufun.is_better(a, b)` Tests if outcome `a` is better than `b` (use `None` for disagreement). Similarily we have, `is_worse`, `is_not_worse` and `is_not_better`.
   - `self.ufun.reserved_value` Your negotiator's reserved value (between 0 and 1). You can access this also as `self.ufun(None)`.
   - `self.ufun(w)` Returns the utility value of the outcome `w`. It is recommended to cast this value to float (i.e. `float(self.ufun(w)`) to support probabilistic utility functions.
   - `self.outcome_space` The [OutcomeSpace](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.outcomes.OutcomeSpace.html) of the negotiation which represent all possible agreements. In ANL 2024, this will always be of type [DiscreteCartesianOutcomeSpace](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.outcomes.DiscreteCartesianOutcomeSpace.html) with a single issue.
   - `self.ufun.invert()` Returns and caches an [InverseUtilityFunction](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.InverseUFun.html#negmas.preferences.InverseUFun) object which can be used to find outcomes given their utilities. The most important services provided by the InverseUtilityFunction returned are:
       - `minmax()` returns the minimum and maximum values of the ufun (will always be (0, 1) approximately in ANL 2024).
       - `best()`, `worst()` returns the best (worst) outcomes.
       - `one_in()`, `some_in()` returns one (or some) outcomes within the given range of utilities.
       - `next_better()`, `next_worse()` returns the next outcome descendingly (ascendingly) in utility value.
- `self.opponent_ufun` A [LinearAdditiveUtilityFunction](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.LinearAdditiveUtilityFunction.html#negmas.preferences.LinearAdditiveUtilityFunction) representing the **opponent's** utility function. You can access this also as `self.private_info["opponent_ufun"]`. This utility function will have a zero reserved value indepdendent of the opponent's true reserved value. You can actually set the reserved value on this object to your best estimate. All ufun funcationality is available in this object.


Other than these objects, your negotiator can access any of the analytic facilities available in NegMAS. For example, you can calculate the [pareto_frontier](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.pareto_frontier.html), [Nash Bargaining Soluion](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.nash_points.html), [Kalai Bargaining Solution](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.kalai_points.html), [points with maximum wellfare](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.max_welfare_points.html), etc. You can check the implementation of the [NashSeeker](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/nash_seeker.py) agent for examples of using these facilities.


Other than implementing the `__call__`, method you can optionally implement one or more of the following callbacks to initialize your agent:

- `on_negotiation_start(state: SAOState)` This [callback](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.negotiators.EvaluatorNegotiator.html#negmas.negotiators.EvaluatorNegotiator.on_negotiation_start) is called once per negotiation after the ufuns are set but before any offers are exchanged.
- `on_preferences_changed(changes)` This [callback](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.negotiators.EvaluatorNegotiator.html#negmas.negotiators.EvaluatorNegotiator.on_preferences_changed) is called **whenever** your negotiator's ufun is changed. This will happen at the beginning of each negotiation but it can also happen again if the ufun is changed **while the negotiation is running**. In ANL 2024, ufuns never change during the negotiation so this callback is equivalent to `on_negotiation_start()` but for future proofness, you should use this callback for any initialization instead to guarantee that this initialization will be re-run in cases of changing utility function.

## Understanding our negotiator

Now we can analyze the simple random negotiator we developed earlier.

- Firstly, we find the current offer that we need to respond to:
  ```python
  offer = state.current_offer
  ```
- **Acceptance Strategy** We then accept this offer if three conditions are satisfied:
  - The offer is not `None` which means that we are not starting the negotiation just now:
  - The offer is not worse than disagreement. This prevents us from accepting irrational outcomes.
  - A random number we generated is less than 0.25. This means we accept rational offers with probability 25%.
    ```python
    if offer is not None and self.ufun.is_not_worse(offer, None) and random.random() < 0.25:
        return SAOResponse(ResponseType.ACCEPT_OFFER, offer)
    ```
- **Offering Strategy** If we decided not to accept the offer, we simply generate a single random outcome and offer it:
  ```python
  return SAOResponse(ResponseType.REJECT_OFFER, self.nmi.random_outcomes(1)[0])
  ```
  
This negotiator did not use the fact that we know the opponent utility function up to reserved value. It did not even use the fact that we know our *own* utility function. As expected, it did not get a good score. Let's develop a simple yet more meaningful agent that uses both of these pieces of information.

Can you now see why is this negotiator is getting negative advantages sometimes? We were careful in our acceptance strategy but not in our *offering strategy*. There is nothing in our code that prevents our negotiator from offering irrational outcomes (i.e. outcomes worse than disagreement for itself) and sometimes the opponent will just accept those. Can you fix this?

## A more meaningful negotiator

How can we use knowledge of our own and our opponent's utility functions (up to reserved value for them)? Here is one possibility: 

- **Acceptance Strategy** We accept offers that have a utility above some *aspiration* level. This aspiration level starts very high (1.0) and goes monotoncially down but never under the reserved value which is reached when the relative time is 1.0 (i.e. by the end of the negotiation). This is implemented in `is_acceptable()` below.
- **Opponent Modeling** We estimate the opponent reserved value under the assumption that they are using a monotonically decreasing curve to select a utility value and offer an outcome around it. This is implemented in `update_reserved_value()` below.

- **Bidding Strategy** Once we have an estimate of their reserved value, we can then find out all outcomes that are rational for both we and them. We can then check the relative time of the negotiation and offer outcomes by conceding over this list of rational outcomes. This is implemented in the `generate_offer()` method below.


```python
from scipy.optimize import curve_fit

def aspiration_function(t, mx, rv, e):
    """A monotonically decreasing curve starting at mx (t=0) and ending at rv (t=1)"""
    return (mx - rv) * (1.0 - np.power(t, e)) + rv

Much better :-)

Let's see how each part of this negotiator works and how they fit together.

### Construction
The first method of the negotiator to be called is the `__init__` method which is called when the negotiator is created **usually before the ufun is set**. You can use this method to construct the negotiator setting initial values for any variables you need to run your agent. 

An important thing to note here is that your negotiator **must** pass any parameters it does not use to its parent to make sure the object is constructed correctly. This is how we implement this in our `SimpleRVFitter`:

```python
def __init__(self, *args, e: float = 5.0, **kwargs):
    super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
```

We then set the variables we need for our negotiator:

- `self.e` stores the exponent of the concession curve we will be use (more on that later).
- `self.opponent_times`, `self.opponent_utilities` keep track of the times the opponent offers and its own utility of its offers. We will use that to estimate the opponent's reserved value using simple curve fitting in `update_reserved_values()`.
- `self._past_oppnent_rv = 0.0` We start assuming that the opponent has zero reserved value. This is an optimistic assumption because it means that anything rational for us is rational for the opponent so we have more negotiation power.
- `self._rational` This is where we will store the list of rational outcomes to concede over. For each outcome we will store our utility, opponent utility and the outcome itself (in that order).

### Overall Algorithm

The overall algorithm is implemented --- as usual --- in the `__call__()` method. This is the complete algorithm:

```python
def __call__(self, state):
    self.update_reserved_value(state.current_offer, state.relative_time)
    if self.is_acceptable(state.current_offer, state.relative_time):
        return SAOResponse(ResponseType.ACCEPT_OFFER, state.current_offer)  
    return SAOResponse(ResponseType.REJECT_OFFER, self.generate_offer(state.relative_time))
```

We start by updating our estimate of the reserved value of the opponent using `update_reserved_value()`. We then call the acceptance strategy `is_acceptable()` to check whether the current offer should be accepted. If the current offer is not acceptable, we call the bidding strategy `generate_offer()` to generate a new offer which we return as our counter-offer. Simple!!

### Opponent Modling (Estimating Reserved Value)

The first step is in our algorithm is to update our estimate of the opponent's reserved value. This is done in three simple steps:

1. If we have not offer from the opponent, there is nothing to do. Just return:
   ```python
   if offer is None:
        return
   ```
2. We append the time and opponent's utility to our running list of opponent offer utilities:
   ```python
   self.opponent_utilities.append(float(self.opponent_ufun(offer)))
   self.opponent_times.append(relative_time)
   ```
3. We apply a simple [curve fitting](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html) algorithm from [scipy](https://scipy.org) to estimate the opponent's reserved value (and its concession exponent but we are not going to use that):
   - We set the bounds of the reserved value to be between zero (minimum possible value) and the minimum utility the opponent ever offered. This assumes that the opponent only offers rational outcomes for itself. The bounds for the concession curve are set to (0.2, 5.0) which is the usual range of exponents used by time-based strategies.
   ```python
   bounds = ((0.2, 0.0), (5.0, min(self.opponent_utilities)))
   ```
   - We then just apply curve fitting while keeping the old estimate. We keep the old estimate to check whether there is enough change to warrent reevaluation of the rational outcome sets in our offering strategy. We ignore any errors keeping the old estimate in that case.
   ```python
   try:
       optimal_vals, _ = curve_fit(
           lambda x, e, rv: aspiration_function(
               x, self.opponent_utilities[0], rv, e
           ),
           self.opponent_times,
           self.opponent_utilities,
           bounds=bounds,
       )
       self._past_oppnent_rv = self.opponent_ufun.reserved_value
       self.opponent_ufun.reserved_value = optimal_vals[1]
   except Exception as e:
       pass
   ```

### Acceptance Strategy

Our acceptance strategy is implemented in `is_acceptable()` and consists of the following steps:

1. Reject if no offer is found (i.e. we are starting the negotiation now):
   ```python
   if offer is None:
       return False
   ```
2. Find our current aspiration level which starts at 1.0 (inidicating we will only accept our best offer in the first step) ending at our reserved value (indicating that we are willing to accept any rational outcome by the end of the negotiation). Use the exponent we stored during construction.
   ```python        
   asp = aspiration_function(state.relative_time, 1.0, self.ufun.reserved_value, self.e)
   ```
3. Accept the offer iff its utility is higher than the aspiration level:
    ```python
    return float(self.ufun(offer)) >= asp
    ```
Note that this acceptance strategy does not use the estimated opponent reserved value (or the opponent's ufun) in any way.

### Bidding Strategy

Now that we have updated our estimate of the opponent reserved value and decided not to accept their offer, we have to generate our own offer which the job of the bidding strategy implementedin `generate_offer()`. This is done in three steps as well:

1. If the difference between the current and last estimate of the opponent reserved value is large enough, we create the rational outcome list:
   ```python
   if (
            not self._rational
            or abs(self.opponent_ufun.reserved_value - self._past_oppnent_rv) > 1e-3
   ):
        self._rational = sorted(
        [
            (my_util, opp_util, _)
            for _ in self.nmi.outcome_space.enumerate_or_sample(
              levels=10, max_cardinality=100_000
            )
            if (my_util := float(self.ufun(_))) > self.ufun.reserved_value
            and (opp_util := float(self.opponent_ufun(_))) > self.opponent_ufun.reserved_value
        ])
    ```
    We simply take all outcomes in the the `outcome_space` and for each of them we prepend our own utility and our opponent's utility if this outcome was better than disagreement for us and for the opponent. We then sort this list. Because each element is a tuple, the list will be sorted ascendingly by our utility with equal values sorted ascendingly by the opponent utility.

2. If there are no rational outcomes (e.g. our estimate of the opponent rv is very wrong), then just revert to offering our top offer
   ```python
   if not self._rational:
        return self.ufun.best()
   ```
3. If we have a rational set, we calculate an spiration level that starts at 1 and ends at 0 (note that we do not need to end at the reserved value because all outcomes in `self._rational` are already no worse than disagreement. We then calculate the outcome that is at the current aspiration level from the end of the rational outcome list and offer it:
   ```python
   asp = aspiration_function(relative_time, 1.0, 0.0, self.e)   
   max_rational = len(self._rational) - 1
   indx = max(0, min(max_rational, int(asp * max_rational)))        
   outcome = self._rational[indx][-1]
   return outcome
   ```

## Other Examples

The ANL package comes with some example negotiators. These are not designed to be stong but to showcase how to use some of the features provided by the platform.

- [MiCRO](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/micro.py) A strong baseline behavioral negotiation strategy developed by de Jonge, Dave in "An Analysis of the Linear Bilateral ANAC Domains Using the MiCRO Benchmark Strategy.", ICJAI 2022. This strategy assumes no knowledge of the opponent utility function and is implemented from scratch to showcase the following:
  - Using `on_preferences_changed` for initialization.
  - Using [PresortingInverseUtilityFunction](https://negmas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/negmas.preferences.PresortingInverseUtilityFunction.html) for inverting a utility function.
- [NashSeeker](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/nash_seeker.py) A naive strategy that simply sets the opponent reserved value to a fixed value and then uses helpers from NegMAS to find the [Nash Bargaining Solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooperative_bargaining) and use it for deciding what to offer. This showcases:
  - Using NegMAS helpers to calculate the pareto-frontier and the Nash Bargaining Solution
- [RVFitter](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/rv_fitter.py) A strategy very similar to the one we implemented earlier as `SimpleRVFitter`. Instead of trying to estiamte the opponent reserved value from the first step, this strategy waits until it collects few offers before attempting the etimation. This showcases:
  - Setting the opponent reserved value based on our best estimate.
  - A simple way to use this estimate for our bidding strategy.
- [Boulware, Conceder, Linear](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/wrappers.py) Time-based strategies that are implemented by just setting construction parameters of an existing NegMAS negotiator
- [StochasticBoulware, StochasticConceder, StochasticLinear](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/wrappers.py) Stochastic versions of the three time-based strategies above implemented by just setting construction parameters of an existing NegMAS negotiator
- [NaiveTitForTat](https://github.com/yasserfarouk/anl/blob/main/src/anl/anl2024/negotiators/builtins/wrappers.py) A simple behavioral strategy implemented by just inheriting from an existing NegMAS negotiator.
