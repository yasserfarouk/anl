When your agent is submitted, it is run in an environment different from that in which the tournament will be run. This means that you cannot use hardcoded paths in your agent. Moreover, you (and we) do not know in advance what will be the current directory when the tournament is run. For this reason, it is required that if you access any files in your agent, you should use a path relative to the file in which the code accessing these files is located. Please note that accessing ANY FILES outside the directory of your agent is prohibited and will lead to immediate disqualification for obvious security reasons. There are no second chances in this one. Let's assume that your file structure is something like that: base \u251c\u2500\u2500 sub \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 myagent.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 otherfiles.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 data \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 myfile.csv \u2514\u2500\u2500 tests Now you want to access the file myfile.csv when you are inside myagent.py . To do so you can use the following code:: import pathlib path_2_myfile = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent.parent / \"data\" / \"myfile.csv\" Can my agent pass data to my other agents between negotiations? NO Passing data to your agents between negotiations will lead to disqualification. Can my agent read data from the HDD outside my agent's folder? NO Your agent can only read files that you submitted to us in your zip file. It cannot modify these files in anyway during the competition. It cannot read from anywhere else in secondary storage. Trying to do so will lead to disqualification. Can my agent write data to the HDD during the negotiation? NO The agent is not allowed to write anything to the hard disk during the competition. Can I print to the screen to debug my agent? PLEASE DO NOT Printing to the screen in your agent will prevent us from monitoring the progress of tournament runs and will slow down the process. Moreover, it is not useful anyway because the tournaments are run in parallel. If you really need to print something (e.g. for debugging purposes), please remove all print statements before submission. We will never touch your code after submission so we cannot remove them. Can I write arbitrary code in my module besides the negotiator class definition? When python imports your module, it runs everything in it so the top level code should be only one of these: - Class definitions - Function definitions - Variable definitions - Arbitrary code that runs in few milliseconds and prints nothing Any other code must be protected inside:: if __name__ == \"__main__\" For example, if you want to run a simulation to test your agent. DO NOT USE SOMETHING LIKE THIS :: anl2024_tournament(....) But something like this:: def main(): anl2024_tournament(....) if __name__ == \"__main__\": main() This way, importing your module will not run the world simulation. I ran a simulation using \"anl tournament2024\" command. Where are my log files? If you did not pass \"--no-log\", you will find the log files at ~/negmas/anl2024/[date-time-uuid] I implement my agent using multiple files. How should I import them? Assume that you have the following file structure base \u251c\u2500\u2500 subfolder \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 component2.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 component1.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 agent.py In your agent.py file, you want to import your other files:: import component1 import subfolder.component2 This will not work because in the actual competition component1.py and component2.py will not be in python path. There are two ways to solve it: The clean way is to use relative imports. You will need to turn your agent int a package by adding empty __init__.py files to every folder you want to import from:: base \u251c\u2500\u2500 sub \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 component2.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 component1.py \u2514\u2500\u2500 agent.py You can now change your import to:: import .component1 import .subfolder.component2 Notice the extra dot ( . ) Another way that does not require any modification of your file structure is to add the following lines before your imports:: import os, sys sys.path.append(os.path.dirname(__file__)) Note that the later method has the disadvantage of putting your components at the end of the path which means that if you have any classes, functions, etc with a name that is defined in any module that appears earlier in the path, yours will be hidden.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq","text":"","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#how-can-i-access-a-data-file-in-my-package","text":"When your agent is submitted, it is run in an environment different from that in which the tournament will be run.
